- 👋 Hi, I’m @abdollahim  
- 🚀 I’m a systems engineer and DevSecOps practitioner working across backend development, network automation, virtualization, and secure infrastructure design.  
- 🧠 My work spans Laravel development, Linux engineering, VMware/vCenter administration, Zabbix and LibreNMS monitoring, rConfig automation, and enterprise backup solutions like Veeam.  
- 🔬 I also develop Wireshark dissectors, perform low‑level protocol analysis, and work on reverse engineering and digital forensics projects.  
- 🛠️ I build production‑grade monitoring ecosystems, create advanced Zabbix templates, and contribute to open‑source tooling for network and system observability.  
- 🌍 I’ve contributed to and translated open‑source projects into Persian/Farsi to help make technology more accessible to my community.  
- 🌱 Always learning — from secure software development to network protocol internals, automation pipelines, and scalable infrastructure patterns.  
- 🤝 Open to collaborating on open‑source projects, infrastructure tooling, monitoring templates, or translating documentation into Persian/Farsi.  
- 📫 Let’s connect and build something meaningful together.
